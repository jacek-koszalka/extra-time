At that point Wilma had given up smoking eighteen years previously but Stanley was still a smoker.</p><p>“It never occurred to me for one single second that I would have lung cancer,” Wilma says. “I just went forward because I fitted the criteria and I thought it was a way to help other people in the future.”</p><p>A computer randomisation programme put Wilma in the fifty per cent of the group who were picked to have the EarlyCDT Lung test and Stanley was placed in the control group, which meant his blood was never tested.</p><p>“I couldn’t believe it when they told me I had lung cancer,” says Wilma. “And I couldn’t believe it when I was out of hospital just a week after the operation.”</p><p>“I did it for other people, but everyone should just get tested for themselves – it doesn’t matter how long ago you stopped the fags, you’re still at risk and I don’t think people know that.”</p><p>Stanley is a great lover of music - the Happy Mondays and Oasis are among his favourites.

Shirley was the first person on the ECLS trial to be diagnosed with lung cancer, the first to be tested, and the first to be cured.</p><p>Shirley was an Auxiliary Nurse and had little hesitation when asked to be part of the screening trial. “I’d seen people that had got lung cancer in my work and it’s not fun. Three of my family were offered the test but I was the only one who did it – hopefully I’m the only one who needed it, because I’ve lost most of my family from different cancers – including an aunt from lung cancer.”</p><p>Shirley smoked for two hours outside the hospital the night before her operation. She has never smoked since. “My brother and another family member smoked much more than me and they both gave up after I got my test result.”</p><p>Sadly, when Shirley returned to work at the hospital after her operation, she found out that one of the theatre nurses she worked with every day had developed symptoms of lung cancer while she was away and had already passed on.</p><p>“She worked in urology and neurology theatres – she had the same job as me. But I never knew until I went back to work a few months after my op. She was diagnosed through this study, but her lung cancer was already at a late stage, she just hadn’t been showing symptoms and she died before I got back to work.”</p><p>Yet another nursing colleague was also offered the test and declined. “She was diagnosed years later with late stage lung cancer and has since died as well.”</p><p>Shirley says: “If it wasn’t for the EarlyCDT Lung test finding my cancer six years ago, I would be getting symptoms about now – and it would be too late.”</p><p>“Surely this test should be available like breast and bowel screens.”</p><p>Shirley looks after her son’s dog most weeks, because her daughter-in-law is pregnant.

I had a scan – nothing. Another scan – nothing. It was only on the fourth scan they found a five centimetre tumour. I was fasttracked through the NHS. And all this time I felt perfectly well.”</p><p>“In November they operated and removed the tumour through keyhole surgery. I’d already done all my Christmas shopping, all the presents were wrapped and labelled in case I wasn’t going to be around to give them.”</p><p>“On December 23rd I had a phone call with the best news: I didn’t have to have chemo, I was in the clear, the operation had been a success. It was the best Christmas present possible and it was all because of the blood test.”</p><p>“The hardest part about being diagnosed is having to tell your family: my husband, son, daughter, and grandchildren. The best part is knowing I have more time to spend enjoying my family.”</p><p>After retiring, Rebecca took a part time job in Asda – and two of her colleagues there were diagnosed with lung cancer (not as part of the trial) and sadly both of them were dead within a year.</p><p>“So many of my friends were not as lucky as me. We all smoked because that’s what we did in our teens – it was glamorous. I’ve been to several funerals recently of friends who’ve died from lung cancer and sat in the crematorium thinking how lucky I’ve been.”</p><p>“If I’d had no blood test and just had a CT scan it would have come back negative and they would have told me to come back in two years, by which time it might well have been too late.”</p><p>“We need this blood test across the UK. It’s saved my life, and everyone should have it. It will save so many lives.”</p><p>Rebecca loves hill walking with her husband Ben of 49 years.

At the time I was smoking 30 a day as I worked in a special hospital where staff and patients were allowed to smoke on the ward.”</p><p>Janet was given a positive result which she found “devastating”. She was scanned every six months until the trial finished, with no tumour found. “Now I just have to keep a very close eye on my respiratory health and visit my GP as soon as I have any concerns.”</p><p>“It’s like breast cancer screening – everyone should do it if they are offered – and it’s far less intrusive than some of the other screening that women have to go through.”</p><p>“My friend Cathy was also part of the trial but she was part of the control group and so her blood was not tested, the good thing is she gave up smoking anyway.”</p><p>Janet loves to go snow walking in the Scottish mountains – as well as much further afield. Last year she and her husband had “a very close encounter” with a grizzly bear whilst walking in Alaska. “Luckily my husband had the bear spray with us, and we followed the advice: walked away backwards, very slowly, making lots of noise. The bear was very close!”</p><p>Janet is also the proud owner of an alpaca, called Cristal, which was given to her on her last birthday by her husband.</p></div>",

I’ve since had an ultrasound for my kidneys, and they found out I had an abdominal aneurism – and they say smoking can cause that as well.”</p><p>John used to smoke 200 cigarettes a week when driving throughout Scotland and Northern Ireland as a sales engineer. “I would smoke in the car, I would smoke in people’s offices and I would smoke in the factories.

We’re all developing cancers all the time but a properly functioning immune system deals with them. If you don’t have all the vitamins and minerals you need, because of an unhealthy diet or lifestyle, then your tumours will grow more.”</p><p>“This is made worse if you are stressed by poverty and you don’t consider yourself important enough to go along to see a doctor.”</p><p>Frank says he could have worked anywhere in the world, but, he “wanted to work with people who come from where I do.”</p><p>He says of the stigma surrounding smoking and lung cancer, “I’ve had patients in my GP surgery who were addicted to drugs and cigarettes who’ve said it was harder to come off nicotine than it was to come off heroin.”</p><p>When talking about the future, Frank is clear: “I would like to see lung cancer detected at an earlier, treatable stage. The EarlyCDT Lung test may be a good way to achieve that goal. Like with bowel cancer screening, we could send out a home test kit for those who are willing to put a blood spot on a piece of cardboard and post it back – others can have a nurse at their GP’s practice do it.”</p><p>Frank cycles to work most days because, “about 10 years ago my wife persuaded me to do a charity cycle ride – and I thought she was talking about going from St Andrews to Edinburgh but that was just the training run – it was from Hanoi up to the Chinese border…”</p><p>Frank is a dedicated clinician, a skilled researcher and a caring GP.

It was Pauline’s job as Clinical Trials Manager to coordinate them all. “I was the hub of the wheel where all the spokes connected.” she says.</p><p>“Scotland’s population has an extremely high lung cancer risk and the fact that we’re diagnosing so very late means we’re most often handing people news when there’s very little we can do – so to have the option to really change peoples’ lives was one of the great excitements about ECLS.”</p><p>“In your career there are windows where you can see that you can really make a difference and when the opportunity comes up you just grab it.”</p><p>Pauline was involved in ECLS from the start. She was involved in honing the message that went out all over Scotland that there might be hope for smokers and ex-smokers who caught the disease early enough.</p><p>“The ECLS message was about encouraging people to be happy to be screened for something that they were quite embarrassed about – thinking ‘smoking and lung cancer, it’s all my fault.’ ”</p><p>“I’m really proud to have been a part of the future of what is hopefully going to be a national lung cancer screening programme.”</p><p>“It’s a very cost effective and non-invasive test but much more important is the personal impact for someone if they are found to have an early lung cancer – people like Rebecca who are alive and well – and can you put a price on that? Of course NHS health economists have to and there are competing calls on budgets, but I think it’s a no brainer.”</p><p>Pauline, “never, ever,” smoked. “My father’s an ex-smoker and from age five I used to lecture him and maybe I helped him stop.”</p><p>When not running clinical trials, Pauline is a glamorous rock ‘n’ roll mum.

Once again, I’ll be sitting down with the one band member who smokes socially and telling him – ‘listen to these people I worked with, for goodness sake, give it up now!’ ”</p></div>",

After seeing him once, he soon passed away.</p><p>Maxine had to deal with this personal grief as well as tell trial participants on over 50 separate occasions that they had positive EarlyCDT Lung test results and were at a higher risk of developing lung cancer themselves.</p><p>“I had to do this for five months and it was really hard – and I got to know them all really well – and I remember in particular one woman who got really defensive with me and said, ‘Are you trying to tell me I’m going to get lung cancer,’ and this kept happening over and over and I would tell them, ‘I’m not saying that, it doesn’t mean that. You will be monitored for the next two years and if we find it during that time, the outcome could be better catching it at an early stage.’” Her voice cracks with the emotion of so many remembered difficult conversations.</p><p>Maxine’s dedication was such that she used to spend many evenings and Saturdays at home calling people to invite them to participate in the trial. “It was the one time I knew they’d be in and I had to build up a rapport with them.”</p><p>“I don’t understand why this isn’t a routine test – it’s a lifesaver.” If, in the future, EarlyCDT Lung is adopted by the NHS across the UK as part of a screening programme for early lung cancer detection then the lives saved will be down to the tireless and emotionally draining work of nurses like Maxine as well as the doctors, research scientists and patients who came forward.</p><p>Maxine has since left the NHS and, after working privately as a nurse on clinical trials, she has gone to train with an ex-NHS consultant to progress a career in aesthetics.</p></div>",

What caused her lung cancer we will never know, although her husband, who passed away 25 years ago was a smoker, and this may have been a factor.</p><p>In 2019 Frances was referred to Stanmore Orthopaedic Hospital for an MRI of her shoulder after she had suffered a post-operative torn rotator cuff. By chance, the radiologist discovered an unusual mass on her right lung. “I was quite taken aback when Northwick Park Hospital called me to make an appointment to investigate my lung.“</p><p>Her respiratory consultant was concerned but ultimately reassuring. “He said, ‘if this is what I think it is, your life is not in danger and we will be able to deal with it, because we have caught it early – but we have to go through a series of tests to make sure I’m right.’”</p><p>”As the consultant was arranging for me to have lots of standard tests to see what this thing on my lung was, we asked his permission to go ahead and have an EarlyCDT Lung test which we knew about through a member of our family.” The doctor had no objection, so they arranged to take the test privately.</p><p>A week later, just as Frances was waiting to go in for the first of her hospital-ordered scans, the results of the EarlyCDT Lung were telephoned through to her daughter. “It came back saying that it was highly likely I had lung cancer.”</p><p>After a further CT scan, PET scan and an Endobronchial Ultrasound (EBUS) the hospital confirmed the diagnosis and removed the top right lobe of her lung and 21 lymph nodes, which thankfully all came back negative. “The experience was not as bad as I was expecting,” says Frances.</p><p>A year later, Frances is now glowing with good health and her GP recently said, after conducting a range of follow up tests, “there’s no reason you shouldn’t live until you’re a hundred – or longer!”.</p><p>“The treatment I got was really good,” she says. “They discovered it completely by chance and I had no symptoms whatsoever.”</p><p>Despite being 77, Frances only retired last year – and that was only because the lingerie shop in nearby Finchley, where she had been manageress for 33 years, closed down. Frances is currently seeking her next challenge.</p></div>",
